  "absContent": "Many cnidarians utilize green-fluorescent proteins (GFPs) as energy-transfer acceptors in bioluminescence. GFPs fluoresce in vivo upon receiving energy from either a luciferase-oxyluciferin excited-state complex or a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated photoprotein. These highly fluorescent proteins are unique due to the chemical nature of their chromophore, which is comprised of modified amino acid (aa) residues within the polypeptide. This report describes the cloning and sequencing of both cDNA and genomic clones of GFP from the cnidarian, Aequorea victoria. The _gfp10_ cDNA encodes a 238-aa-residue polypeptide with a calculated _M<sub>r</sub>_ of 26888. Comparsion of A. victoria GFP genomic clones shows three different restriction enzyme patterns which suggests that at least three different genes are present in the A. victoria population at Friday Harbor, Washington. The _gfp_ gene encoded by the Î»GFP2 genomic clone is comprised of at least three exons spread over 2.6 kb. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and the gene will aid in the elucidation of structure-function relationships in this unique class of proteins.",

  "absContent": "The role of memory in guiding attention in real scenes is complex. One way that experience might guide search is by reducing the areas of the scene searched and directing search away from irrelevant regions (Neider and Zelinsky, 2008, Wolfe et al., 2011). We explored whether this is a significant factor in guiding search in immersive natural environments. We performed the search task in a 3D virtual environment, as well as in a 2D version that was parallel in task structure. Subjects searched for targets that were located on one of four surfaces in either of two rooms. We investigated the source of improvement from learning the space at both global and local levels: i) which room contains the target and ii) in which part of that room the target is located. We found that the probability of choosing the correct room to search on first entry is higher in 3D than in 2D, and improves in both cases. The number of room entries required to find the targets was also lower in 3D and decreased over episodes. More fixations inside the rooms are directed to surfaces that potentially contain targets in both 2D and 3D (increased from 60% to 87% of fixations after 24 trials in 3D). Surface fixations even early in the experiment indicate the influence of prior scene knowledge. Together these results indicate that memory representations facilitate search by restricting attention to the relevant parts of the environment while excluding the irrelevant parts at the global level (choosing the correct room) and also at the local level (looking at relevant regions inside the room). In addition, the data also suggest that global memory is used more in 3D, potentially because of the higher energetic or temporal cost of changing the region to be searched.",
